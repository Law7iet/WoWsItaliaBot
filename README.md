## TODO

#### Representations
An authenticated user can ask to be the representative of his clan.
Each clan can't have more than 2 representatives.
It's triggered by a command and the bot has to check if the clan has already the representative.
The command shows an embed with 2 buttons: apply for the representant and remove (himself) the representant.
An additional command needed to manage the representants for the mod.

#### Nickname
Add a command to refresh the user "in-game name".
Add an optional command for set up the user "nickname" (marked between `()`).

#### Clan Battle Data
Store a clan battle data during the command `/classifica`.

#### Login
Swap `/login` and `/auth` name?
